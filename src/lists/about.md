# Lists

An Exemplar Application Demonstrating the Power of React Server

Lists serves as a prime demonstration of React Server's capabilities. This application exemplifies reactivity, WebPush support, and the seamless orchestration of a moderately complex server-side architecture with multiple nested components.

You can find the code of the [backend](https://github.com/C5H8NNaO4/lists-app-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/C5H8NNaO4/lists-app-frontend) on github.

Feel free to utilize Listsâ€”it's open-source and completely free. Host it on your own server if you prefer, customize it with your own features, or even contribute to our open-source repository. The possibilities are endless!
