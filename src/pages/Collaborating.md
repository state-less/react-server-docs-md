## Branching Guide for React Server

This branching guide delineates an effective strategy leveraging feature branches, release branches, and fix branches to optimize your team's workflow and streamline the software development process for React Server.

### Branching Overview

There are three main types of branches in this strategy:

1. Feature branches: feature/my-feature
2. Release branches: release/v2.0.1-pre-alpha
3. Fix branches: fix/issue-description

### Branching Workflow

#### Feature Branches

- Create a new branch from the latest release branch.
- Name the branch using the format: feature/my-feature
- Work on your feature, committing changes as needed.
- When the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it into the release branch.

#### Release Branches

- Create a new release branch from the master branch.
- Name the branch using the format: release/v2.0.1-pre-alpha
- Merge completed feature branches into the release branch in iterations.
- Test and review the release branch thoroughly.
- When the release branch is stable and ready, create a pull request to merge it into the master branch.
- Tag the new release on the master branch with the appropriate SemVer.

#### Fix Branches

- Create a new branch from the latest release or master branch, depending on where the issue is found.
- Name the branch using the format: fix/issue-description
- Work on the fix, committing changes as needed.
- Create a pull request to merge the fix branch into both the release and master branches.

### Important Notes

- Master branch only receives stable SemVer releases merged from release branches.
- Release branches receive completed features and undergo testing and review before merging into the master branch.
- Branch protection is enabled on the master branch to ensure stability.
